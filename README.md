tm-svbtle
=========

Completely rewritten for Tumblr, tm-svbtle is a new responsive Tumblr theme that will look fantastic on everything from the largest desktop monitor to the smallest smart-phone.

###Is this theme unoriginal?

tm-svbtle was forked from the wp-svbtle theme. Though, imitation is the biggest form of flattery. For more information about wp-svbtle, visit the GitHub repository.

###What is a responsive design?

A responsive website changes it's layout depending on the size of the display screen. This way no matter what device you're using tm-svbtle will look great. To see an example the theme responding to different types of screens, simply install tm-svbtle and view on multiple devices.

###How do I take advantage of smart-phone responsiveness?

At the bottom of your blog's customization panel find the section that says "Use Optimized Mobile Layout." Make sure that box is unchecked. That's it. When you our your visitor pulls up your site on a mobile device they will see the custom theme and not the standard Tumblr mobile version. If you would rather use Tumblr's mobile layout, recheck the box.

###Can I customize tm-svbtle?

Of course! There are many options, including the main color, the fonts, and multiple options like showing tags, enabling infinite scrolling, and more.

###Does tm-svbtle support custom languages?

Yes! All text used in tm-svbtle uses Tumblr's custom localization feature. This means that all theme related text will read correctly no matter what language your blog uses!

###Can you add support for this, or tell me how to change that?

Maybe. Probably. Visit my personal blog and use the ask feature. You can also ask via Twitter.

###Why is tm-svbtle at GitHub and not in the Tumblr Theme Garden?

Tumblr's Theme Garden is a boys-club that isn't friendly to individual developers. The easiest way to install this theme is to copy the contents of index.html and past it into your "edit HTML" while customizing. All of the options will appear after you refresh the customize page.
